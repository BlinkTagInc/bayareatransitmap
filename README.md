# Bay Area Transit Map

An interactive map showing the service areas of 37 of the Bay Area's transit agencies.

The Bay Area has 37+ transit agencies, and its challenging to know where they all are, how they connect and which agencies serve a specific area.

https://bayareatransitmap.com shows a service area of each transit agency based on the GTFS for the agency.
